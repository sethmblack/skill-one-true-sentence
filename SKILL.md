# One True Sentence

Find the truest, most essential sentence that captures what you're trying to say. Build from there.

---

## When to Use

- Stuck at the beginning of a piece
- Writer's block on an existing draft
- Unclear about what a piece is really about
- Lost in complexity and need to find the core
- Need to find the thesis or central truth
- Request for "what am I really trying to say?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | What you're trying to write about |
| context | No | Any draft, notes, or background |
| audience | No | Who will read this |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Clear the Noise

Forget:
- What you think you should say
- What sounds impressive
- What others have written
- The structure you planned
- The length you need

Ask only: What is true here? What do I actually know?

**Hemingway:** "All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know."

### Step 2: Find What You Know

Not what you've read. Not what you've heard. What you know.

- What have you experienced directly?
- What have you seen that others haven't?
- What do you believe that you can defend?
- What would you say if you could only say one thing?

The true sentence comes from knowledge, not research. From experience, not theory.

### Step 3: State It Simply

The true sentence is:
- Short (usually)
- Concrete (if possible)
- Declarative (not a question)
- Specific (not abstract)

**Test:** Can you say it to someone in conversation? If it sounds like writing, it's not true yet. Find the version you'd actually say.

### Step 4: Build from There

Once you have the true sentence:
- Write the next true sentence
- Then the next
- Keep going until you've said what needs to be said
- Stop when you've said it

**Hemingway:** "Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now."

## Output Format

```markdown
## Finding the One True Sentence

### The Noise (what to clear)
[List of things that are getting in the way - expectations, conventions, false starts]

### What You Actually Know
[Core knowledge, experience, or belief underlying the topic]

### Candidate Sentences
1. [First attempt]
   - **Too abstract?** [yes/no]
   - **Too long?** [yes/no]
   - **Would you say it?** [yes/no]

2. [Second attempt - refined]
   ...

### The One True Sentence
**[The sentence]**

### Building From Here
[2-3 sentences that follow naturally from the true sentence, showing how the piece can proceed]
```

---

## Constraints

- The sentence must be something you know, not something you've heard
- It must be true - not clever, not impressive, not what's expected
- It must be simple enough to say out loud
- It must be specific enough to mean something
- If you can't find it, you don't know what you're writing about yet

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:**
- Topic: Writing a company memo about layoffs
- Context: Need to announce 15% reduction. Want to be honest but not devastating.
- Audience: All employees

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Finding the One True Sentence

### The Noise (what to clear)
- Corporate euphemisms ("rightsizing," "workforce reduction")
- What other companies say in these memos
- The temptation to hide bad news in good news
- The desire to seem like it's not my decision
- The structure of typical announcement memos

### What You Actually Know
- We are letting go of people who did nothing wrong
- This decision will hurt families
- The company's survival required this
- I am responsible for this decision
- The people staying need to trust that this was necessary

### Candidate Sentences
1. "We have made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce."
   - **Too abstract?** Yes - "difficult decision" and "reduce workforce" are evasions
   - **Too long?** No
   - **Would you say it?** No - I wouldn't say "reduce workforce" to someone's face

2. "Today we are letting 47 people go."
   - **Too abstract?** No - specific number
   - **Too long?** No
   - **Would you say it?** Yes - this is what is actually happening

3. "Forty-seven of us will lose their jobs today, and I'm responsible for that."
   - **Too abstract?** No
   - **Too long?** No
   - **Would you say it?** Yes

### The One True Sentence
**"Forty-seven of us will lose their jobs today, and I'm responsible for that."**

### Building From Here
"I won't hide behind passive voice or committee decisions. Here is why this happened. Here is what we're doing for the people leaving. Here is what comes next for those staying. I'll answer any question you have."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Ernest Hemingway** expert persona. Use it when stuck, lost, or unclear about what you're really trying to say.

"All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know."
